# Single source of truth for required status checks per repository.
#
# Consumed by:
# - Terraform branch protection (terraform/branch-protection/)
# - Prow Tide context_options (prow/control-plane/config.yaml)
#
# "base_checks" are required for ALL repos in branch protection only.
# Tide does not need to require "tide" or "EasyCLA" on itself.
#
# "repos" lists per-repo CI checks that must pass before merge.
# Repos with empty lists still get branch protection with base_checks
# but have no repo-specific required contexts for Tide.
