# The slash workflow handles slash commands
#
# Slash commands are given through comments on pull requests
# and may be used only by individuals with "write" access to
# the repository (i.e. maintainers).
#
# Slash commands must be placed at the very beginning of the
# first line of a comment. More details are available in the
# action docs: https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#how-comments-are-parsed-for-slash-commands
#
# The workflow looks for and dispatches to another workflow
# named <command>-command which must exist in the repository.
#
# Supported commands:
# - /retest: re-run failed GitHub actions associated with the
#            caller of this workflow
#
# When a command is recognised, the rocket and eyes emojis are added
#
# To use this in a repo:
