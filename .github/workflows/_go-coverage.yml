# Reusable Go Coverage Workflow
#
# This workflow generates Go test coverage reports and posts them as PR comments.
# It runs on pull requests, pushes to the main branch, scheduled intervals, and manual triggers.
#
# To use this in a repo:
#
# name: Go coverage
# on:
#   pull_request:
#     branches: ["main"]
#   push:
#     branches: ["main"]
#   schedule:
#     - cron: '14 3 2 */2 *'
#   workflow_dispatch:
#
# jobs:
#   go-coverage:
#     name: Go coverage
#     uses: tektoncd/plumbing/.github/workflows/_go-coverage.yml@main
#     secrets:
#       CHATOPS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CHATOPS_TOKEN }}
