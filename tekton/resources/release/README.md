# Tekton Resources for Release Automation

This folder contains various Tekton resource used to automate Tekton's own
release management. These components are written so that they can be used by
all the projects in the `tektoncd` GitHub org.
The core release pipelines are still owned by the specific project.

## Tasks and Pipelines

### Install Tekton Release

The task `install-tekton-release` installs a release of a Tekton project from the YAML file in the
release bucket.

Inputs are:

- Param `projectName`: the name of the project (pipeline, trigger,
dashboard, experimental)
- Param `version`: the version to be installed, e.g. "v0.7.0"
- Param `releaseBucket`. The release file
is expected to be at `<releaseBucket>/<projectName>/previous/<version>/release.yaml`
- Workspace `targetCluster` to be bound to a secret that holds the kubeconfig of the target cluster

The release task can use a `kustomize` overlay if available. The name of the
overlay folder is specified via the `environment` parameter.
The overlay folder must contain a `kustomize.yaml` configuration file. It may
also contain a `pre` folder. Any `*.sh` script found in the folder will be
executed before the release is installed.

### Save Release Logs

The pipeline `save-release-logs` fetches the logs from a release pipelines
and stores them in the release bucket along with the release YAML.
This pipeline is triggered automatically when a release pipeline is executed,
specifically when the "publish" task of the release is executed successfully.
The `tekton-events` event listener receives the CloudEvent, and triggers
the `save-release-logs` with the correct credentials to store the logs
in the release bucket, either the main one or the nightly one.

### Create Draft Release

The pipeline `release-draft` calculates the list of PRs merged between the
previous release and a specified revision. It also builds a list of authors and
uses PRs and authors to build a draft new release in GitHub. It also attaches
the `release.yaml` from the release bucket to the GitHub release.

This pipeline must be executed after the release images and YAML have been
produced. Running this task multiple times will create multiple drafts; old
drafts have to be pruned manually when needed.

Once the draft release is created, the release manager needs to edit the draft,
arranging PRs in the right category, highlighting important changes and creating
a release tag line.

Parameters are: `package`, `release-name`, `release-tag`, `previous-release-tag`
, `git-revision`, `bucket` and `rekor-uuid`.

An example using `tkn`. Start defining a few environment variables, obtain the
REKOR_UUID and then run the pipeline:

```shell
export TEKTON_RELEASE_GIT_SHA=9c884fb3d3bf35c0a251936626f2ca9f17b5c183
export TEKTON_PACKAGE=tektoncd/pipeline
export TEKTON_VERSION=v0.9.0
export TEKTON_OLD_VERSION=v0.8.0
export TEKTON_RELEASE_NAME="Bengal Bender"

RELEASE_FILE=https://infra.tekton.dev/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/${TEKTON_VERSION}/release.yaml
CONTROLLER_IMAGE_SHA=$(curl $RELEASE_FILE | egrep 'gcr.io.*controller' | cut -d'@' -f2)
REKOR_UUID=$(rekor-cli search --sha $CONTROLLER_IMAGE_SHA | grep -v Found | head -1)
echo -e "CONTROLLER_IMAGE_SHA: ${CONTROLLER_IMAGE_SHA}\nREKOR_UUID: ${REKOR_UUID}"

tkn pipeline start \
  --workspace name=shared,volumeClaimTemplateFile=workspace-template.yaml \
  --workspace name=credentials,secret=release-secret \
  -p package="${TEKTON_PACKAGE}" \
  -p git-revision="$TEKTON_RELEASE_GIT_SHA" \
  -p release-tag="${TEKTON_VERSION}" \
  -p previous-release-tag="${TEKTON_OLD_VERSION}" \
  -p release-name="${TEKTON_RELEASE_NAME}" \
  -p bucket="gs://tekton-releases/pipeline" \
  -p rekor-uuid="$REKOR_UUID" \
  release-draft
```
