# Add Team Members

`add-team-members` is a custom interceptor for Tekton Triggers that enriches the
payload of an incoming request with the list of public members of the org and,
optionally, the list of maintainers for the project.

## Interface

`add-team-members` expects the URL to the PR representation to be included in the
incoming JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "add_team_members":
  {
    "org_base_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tektoncd/"
  },
  "other-keys": "other=values"
}
```

It returns the original JSON payload untouched, with the addition of the org
members. If the owner of the Github token passed in `GITHUB_TOKEN` is also
a member of the organization then [both concealed and public members will be
returned](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/orgs#list-organization-members).

```json
{
  "add_team_members":
  {
    "org_base_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tektoncd/",
    "team": "plumbing",
    "org_members": ["a", "b", "c"]
  },
  "other-keys": "other=values"
}
```

### Adding the maintainers
When we add the `team` key to the body, the maintainers for that repo will also
be added:

```json
{
  "add_team_members":
  {
    "org_base_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tektoncd/",
    "team": "plumbing"
  },
  "other-keys": "other=values"
}
```

It returns the original JSON payload untouched, with the addition of both the
org members and the maintainers:

```json
{
  "add_team_members":
  {
    "org_base_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tektoncd/",
    "team": "plumbing",
    "org_members": ["a", "b", "c"],
    "maintainers_team_members": ["a", "b"]
  },
  "other-keys": "other=values"
}
```

HTTP Headers are left untouched.

## Example usage:

A trigger in an event listener:

```yaml
- name: comment-trigger
  interceptors:
    - github:
        secretRef:
          secretName: ci-webhook
          secretKey: secret
        eventTypes:
          - issue_comment
    - cel:
        filter: >-
          body.action == 'created' &&
          in('pull_request', body.issue) &&
          && body.issue.state == 'open' &&
          body.comment.body.matches('^/test($| [^ ]*$)')
        overlays:
        - key: add_team_members.org_base_url
          expression: "body.organization.url"
    - webhook:
        objectRef:
          kind: Service
          name: add-team-member
          apiVersion: v1
          namespace: tekton-ci
    - cel:
        filter: >-
          body.comment.user.login in body.extensions.add_team_members.maintainers_team_members
```

## Installation

The interceptor is installed via `ko`:
```
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=ghcr.io/tektoncd/plumbing
ko apply -P -f tekton/ci/interceptors/add-team-members/config/
```

Eventually it should be included in nightly releases and installed from there.
